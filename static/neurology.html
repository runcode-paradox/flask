        <h1 style="text-align: center;">NEURO SCIENCE</h1><h2>Definition:</h2>
        <p>Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, its functions, and disorders. It is a multidisciplinary field that combines various disciplines such as physiology, anatomy, molecular biology, developmental biology, mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and computer science.

            
            
             Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.
            
            Scope: The scope of neuroscience has broadened over time to include different approaches used to study the nervous system, ranging from cellular and molecular neuroscience to cognitive and behavioral neuroscience.
            
            Research Areas: Neuroscience encompasses a wide range of research areas, including neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurochemistry, neuropharmacology, neurogenetics, neurodevelopment, neuroimaging, and neuroinformatics.</p>
        
        <h2>Applications:</h2><p> Neuroscience has applications in various fields, including medicine, psychology, psychiatry, neurology, neurosurgery, pharmacology, artificial intelligence, robotics, and neuroengineering.</p>
        
        <h2>Neurological Disorders:</h2><p>Neuroscience plays a crucial role in understanding and treating neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and psychiatric disorders like depression and schizophrenia.</p>
        
        <h2>Neuroscience Institutes:</h2><p> There are several renowned neuroscience institutes around the world, such as the Institute of Neurosciences in Kolkata, India, and the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, India.
        
            Neuroscience is a field that continues to advance our understanding of the brain and nervous system, leading to new insights into human cognition, behavior, and the development of potential treatments for neurological disorders.</p>
